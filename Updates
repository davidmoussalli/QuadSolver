1. Update programming standards to be a single one(example gnu programming standard), put a pdf or a short text whereby 
   you are showing the license of the items you are using with the current ones being on addendum
2. put on documentation for gcc, IEEE floating points
3. Put in FLAGS in programming standards. State what Flags will be used
4. Choose a license that you will be using
5. Break up quadsolver.c to main, seperate functions and put it into different directories so that it can be unit testable
6. In quadsolver.c, take input after running the program. Use fgets for taking input? DONT USE ATOF
7. Also, in quadsolver.c, the input should be a double
8. Validate inputs.
9. Use CUnit
10. Try to test with these inputs..
1 2 1
2 1 1
1e37 2e37 1e37
1e40 2 1 --> discriminant should be calculated
1 2 1a --> should not accept this
